    <h1>Mortgage Market Analysis: Risk, Rates, and Market Efficiency Over Time</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project examines the complex world of mortgage rates and related time series data, focusing on mortgage-backed securities pricing and delinquency rates from 2021 to 2025. Mortgages represent the largest financial commitment most Americans will make, while for financial institutions, mortgage lending generates substantial revenue through interest payments. Banks often securitize these loans into mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are then traded among institutions. However, as delinquency rates - the failure of borrowers to make payments - fluctuate, these securities' valuations are directly impacted.</p>
        
        <p>Our analysis seeks to understand how efficiently the mortgage market prices risk by examining the relationships between interest rates, credit spreads, delinquency rates, and MBS pricing. Through comprehensive data visualization, we explore whether lenders appropriately adjust pricing based on actual default risk, and what these patterns reveal about market dynamics during a period of significant economic volatility.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Introduction</h2>
        <p>Our comprehensive dataset contains daily observations of key mortgage market indicators with varying historical coverage going back to 1971 for some metrics. The dataset includes delinquency rates, 30-year fixed mortgage rates, 30-year rates for borrowers with FICO scores of 740 and above, 15-year fixed rates, and mortgage-backed security prices. All data sources originate from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis economic database (FRED).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Dataset Specifications:</strong><br>
            • Total observations: 4,583 row entries<br>
            • Full time range: 1971-2025 (varies by variable)<br>
            • MBS and delinquency data: 2009-2025<br>
            • Interest rate data complete overlap: 2021-2025<br>
            • Original variables: 6 core columns<br>
            • Data frequency: Mixed (daily to weekly, interpolated to daily)<br>
            • Normalization: Z-scores applied for cross-variable comparison<br>
            • Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED)</p>
        
        <p>To ensure consistency across datasets with varying publication frequencies and availability periods, we interpolated the data to create daily observations. Different variables have different historical ranges - while some mortgage rate data extends back to 1971, the complete overlap of all variables occurs during 2021-2025. Z-score normalization was applied to enable meaningful comparisons between variables with different scales and units, preserving the underlying distribution shapes while making the data more interpretable across different economic conditions.</p>

        <h3>Visualization 1: Interactive Mortgage Payment Analysis (Sankey Diagram)</h3>
        <div class="visualization-container">
            <iframe src="sankey.html" class="viz-frame"></iframe>
            <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> This fully interactive Sankey diagram reveals a critical insight about mortgage dynamics that borrowers often overlook. Users can manipulate mortgage amount, interest rates (either manual or historical from 1971-2025), and loan terms to observe how payments flow between principal and interest over time. A striking revelation emerges: <strong>at certain interest rate levels, payments toward interest can actually exceed those toward principal</strong>, particularly in the early years of higher-rate mortgages. This visualization allows users to experiment with different scenarios and witness firsthand how the 2022-2023 rate spikes would have dramatically altered the principal-to-interest ratio compared to the ultra-low rates of 2020-2021. The interactive nature enables borrowers to understand exactly when and why they might be paying more toward interest than building equity, making this a powerful tool for financial literacy and mortgage decision-making.</p>

        <h3>Visualization 2 & 3: MBS Risk Analysis - Time Series and Annual Overview</h3>
        <div class="visualization-container">
            <iframe src="mbs_risk_analysis.html" class="viz-frame"></iframe>
            <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> These complementary visualizations reveal a fundamental principle of finance and economics in action: <strong>delinquency rates and mortgage-backed securities prices demonstrate a clear inverse relationship</strong>, even after z-score normalization. This relationship validates core risk-return theory - as default risk increases (higher delinquency), MBS valuations decrease correspondingly. The time series chart shows this relationship evolving from 2009-2025, with the most dramatic divergence occurring during the 2020-2022 period when MBS prices soared as delinquency rates plummeted to historic lows. The annual bar chart reinforces this pattern, showing how investors' risk assessments align with actual default performance year over year. Interestingly, the relationship appears most pronounced during periods of market stress, suggesting that MBS pricing becomes more sensitive to credit risk during uncertain times. This inverse correlation provides valuable insights for investors seeking to identify periods when MBS may be mispriced relative to underlying default risk.</p>

        <h3>Visualization 4: Interest Rate Analysis</h3>
        <div class="visualization-container">
            <iframe src="interest_rates.html" class="viz-frame"></iframe>
            <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> This time series reveals remarkable synchronization across mortgage product types during the 2021-2025 period, with a critical insight about market dynamics under stress. <strong>The three rate types follow each other with striking precision through every major movement</strong> - when one jumps, they all jump together, maintaining their relative relationships even during the dramatic 2022-2023 volatility. The 15-year fixed rate (orange) consistently trades below the others as expected, while the distance between the 30-year fixed (blue) and 30-year conforming FICO 740+ (green) lines represents the credit spread premium. However, a counterintuitive pattern emerges: <strong>during periods of higher delinquency and market stress, this spread actually contracts rather than expands</strong>. This suggests that in harsh economic times, the presence of widespread defaults creates a "rising tide" effect where credit risk premiums compress because the entire market faces elevated risk. This phenomenon challenges conventional wisdom and indicates that during systemic stress, even high-FICO borrowers face increased pricing pressure, reducing the traditional credit score advantage.</p>

        <h3>Visualization 5: Credit Spread vs. Default Risk Analysis (Scatter Plot)</h3>
        <div class="visualization-container">
            <iframe src="spread_vs_delinquency.html" class="viz-frame"></iframe>
            <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> This scatter plot with regression analysis (r = -0.487, n = 261 days) reveals a surprising and counterintuitive relationship that challenges conventional credit risk pricing models. Rather than the expected positive correlation where higher delinquency rates would command higher credit spreads, <strong>the data shows a negative correlation</strong> - as delinquency rates increase, the spread between conforming FICO 740+ rates and standard 30-year fixed rates actually decreases. This phenomenon suggests that during periods of widespread defaults, lenders compress credit spreads, potentially because: (1) systemic risk affects all borrowers, reducing the relative advantage of high credit scores, (2) regulatory or competitive pressures limit spread expansion during stress periods, or (3) flight-to-quality effects concentrate in other assets rather than mortgage rate differentiation. Each data point represents daily market conditions, revealing that this inverse relationship persists across various market environments, not just during crisis periods. This finding has significant implications for both lenders' risk management and borrowers' timing of mortgage applications.</p>

        <h2>Key Findings and Conclusions</h2>
        <p><strong>Market Efficiency Assessment:</strong> Our analysis of the 2021-2025 period reveals a mortgage market that demonstrated both efficiency and volatility. The relationship between credit spreads and delinquency rates suggests that lenders maintained relatively effective risk pricing mechanisms even during periods of significant market stress.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rate Volatility Impact:</strong> The dramatic interest rate fluctuations during this period with rates rising sharply in 2022-2023 before gradually declining created challenges for both borrowers and lenders. The interactive payment analysis demonstrates how these changes translated into substantial affordability impacts for consumers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Risk-Return Relationships:</strong> The correlation between MBS pricing and delinquency rates confirms that secondary markets efficiently incorporated credit risk into security valuations. Annual aggregations show clear patterns of risk-adjusted returns that align with broader economic cycles.</p>
        
        <h3>Future Research Directions</h3>
        <p>The insights revealed by these visualizations open several compelling avenues for future investigation that could significantly advance our understanding of mortgage market dynamics and risk pricing efficiency.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Non-Linear Spread-Delinquency Relationship:</strong> The counterintuitive negative correlation between credit spreads and delinquency rates demands deeper investigation. Future analysis should focus on specific time periods to measure this non-linear relationship more precisely, potentially using regime-switching models or threshold regression techniques to identify breakpoints where the relationship fundamentally changes. Understanding when and why spreads compress during high-delinquency periods could reveal previously unknown market inefficiencies or regulatory influences.</p>
        
        <p><strong>MBS Opportunity Identification:</strong> The clear inverse relationship between MBS prices and delinquency rates creates opportunities for sophisticated timing analysis. Future research could develop models to identify periods when MBS securities may be trading at favorable valuations relative to underlying default risk. By analyzing the risk-return profile across different historical periods, researchers could identify whether certain market conditions create systematic mispricing opportunities that haven't been seen before, or whether apparent anomalies are justified by broader macroeconomic factors not captured in current models.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Macroeconomic Context Integration:</strong> The synchronized movement of interest rates and the compression of credit spreads during stress periods suggest that traditional mortgage pricing models may inadequately account for systemic risk factors. Future work should incorporate broader macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates, housing price indices, GDP volatility, and Federal Reserve policy stance to determine whether observed pricing patterns represent rational adjustments to changing macro conditions or present genuine arbitrage opportunities for informed investors.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Regime-Dependent Analysis:</strong> The mortgage market appears to exhibit different behaviors during normal versus stress periods. Future research should employ techniques to identify distinct market regimes and analyze whether the relationships observed here hold consistently across different economic cycles, or whether the 2021-2025 period represents a unique environment unlikely to repeat in future cycles.</p>
